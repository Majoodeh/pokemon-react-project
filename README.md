# Poekemon website (name to be changed later):

### The Concept

A React-based Pokémon hub that combines a functional **Pokedex** (data browsing) with an interactive **Memory Match Game**. The goal is to create a playful, responsive experience for fans to discover Pokémon and test their memory.

---

### Current Status

- **UI/UX:** Approximately 90% complete (layouts, styling, and navigation are established).

- **Functionality:** About 40% complete (basic routing and static pages are don. core features like the Memory Game and Pokedex filtering are the next step).

---

### Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 (Interactivity):** Building out the Memory Game logic and Pokedex filtering using mock data (**Current focus**).
2. **Phase 2 (Global State):** Implementing **Context API** to handle "Favorite Pokémon" and game scores across pages.
3. **Phase 3 (Integration):** Replacing mock data with live fetches from the **PokéAPI**.

---

### MUST-HAVES

- **Multi-page navigation** via `react-router-dom`.
- **Global state management** using Context API.
- **Dynamic Pokémon Detail pages.**
- **Fully responsive design.**

---

### NICE-TO-HAVES

- Custom Hooks for API fetching.
- favorites list saved to **LocalStorage**.
- filtering options

---

### Libraries & Technologies Used

- **React**
- **React DOM**
- **React Router DOM**
- **React Card Flip** – Provides the card-flipping animation logic for the memory match game.
- **Tailwind CSS / @tailwindcss/vite**
